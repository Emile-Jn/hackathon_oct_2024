       " 'It was Sam Walton’s purpose to help people live \\nbetter lives. He wanted to help them save money \\nso they could invest in their families and their \\ncommunities. He wanted to help people build \\nsomething meaningful and worthwhile and to live a \\nbetter life. He wanted to leave things better than he’d \\nfound them. That’s the legacy he left our company, \\nand we remain committed to being a force for good \\nin the communities we serve, all over the world. \\nFor Walmart, this means actively addressing the \\nenvironmental and societal issues most relevant to \\nour business and stakeholders, and we win when our \\ncustomers, associates, suppliers, communities, and \\nplanet are better off because of Walmart.\\nIn our 61 years, we’ve shown that we’re capable of \\nbig things. We’ve embraced change and innovation \\nwhile staying true to our roots, and we’ve grown \\nand expanded without forgetting our purpose. \\nWe’re a people-led, tech-powered omni-channel \\nretailer dedicated to helping people save money \\nand live better, and we’re still built upon our original \\nfoundation of timeless values. \\nThroughout our ESG Issue Briefs  and these ESG \\nHighlights, you’ll see the ways our commitments build \\non this foundation. We’ve focused on four themes \\nthat guide our action: Opportunity, Sustainability, \\nCommunity, and Ethics & Integrity. And at Walmart, we’re doing more than simply managing risks in these \\nareas. Managing risk isn’t enough. We have to think \\ndifferently, and we have to do more. We have adopted \\na mindset that prioritizes outcomes for business and \\nsociety — and a regenerative ambition. I’m proud \\nof the ways our team is bringing these principles to \\nlife across our business. We’re giving back, and we’re \\nfollowing Sam’s example: we’re leaving things better \\nthan we found them.\\nAt the same time, we’re mindful that none of this \\nwould be possible without our associates taking \\naction and bringing these goals to life. We’re grateful \\nfor our associates’ hard work and positive mindsets, \\ntheir flexibility and their resilience, and it’s important \\nto Walmart that we create opportunities and invest \\nin the people who have invested in our mission. \\nWe want to build careers, not just jobs. In the U.S. \\nalone, about 75% of salaried store, club, and supply \\nchain management started their careers as hourly \\nassociates.

       " 'A Message from our Chief Sustainability Officer\\nWalmart has grown from humble roots with the \\nenduring purpose of helping people save money and \\nlive better. \\nAs a people-led, tech-powered omni-channel retailer, \\nwe want to help people live better not only through \\nour customer proposition but in the way we deliver it, \\nby: \\n• Creating opportunity: Being an employer of \\nchoice, where all associates feel they belong, can \\ngain skills, and can advance through career paths \\nranging from retail management to health care to \\ntech. \\n• Enhancing sustainability:  Operating efficiently, \\neffectively, and sustainably in service of the \\ncustomer and communities; building a resilient \\nproduct supply chain that helps create prosperity \\nfor people while sustaining and restoring our \\nplanet. \\n• Strengthening community:  Providing access \\nto everyday goods and services as well as good \\njobs, tax revenue, and philanthropic support for \\ncommunity needs.\\n• Upholding the highest standards of ethics and \\nintegrity:  Being the most trusted retailer so our \\nstakeholders choose us every time. \\nOur environmental, social, and governance efforts \\ncenter on the themes of opportunity, sustainability, \\ncommunity, and ethics and integrity. Our efforts \\ncreate shareholder value by creating value for our \\nstakeholders — our customers, associates, suppliers, business partners, community partners, and even the \\nplanet (because as a retailer, our commodity sourcing, \\nfacilities, and customer communities depend on \\nhealthy ecosystems and climate). We believe that \\nwhen Walmart creates value for stakeholders, \\nwe strengthen our business and deliver value to \\nour shareholders, which allows us to invest in the \\ncapabilities to serve our stakeholders even better…\\npropelling a virtuous cycle of shared value. We aim to \\nbecome a regenerative company — one that not only \\nsustains but strengthens the people and the world \\naround us. \\nRecent examples illustrate our approach: \\nInvesting in our associates:  We have raised minimum \\nstarting wages over 90% and average hourly wages \\n54% since 2015 through improvements in jobs and \\ncareer paths, including changes based on direct \\nengagement, dialogue, and feedback from associates. \\nWalmart associates have also helped shape and \\nintroduce additional benefits, such as extended \\nparental leave, adoption benefits, and expanded vision \\ncare benefits. Our on-the-job training and programs \\nsuch as Walmart Academy provide opportunities for \\nassociates to grow their skills and careers; indeed \\napproximately 88% of Walmart U.S. store roles above \\nentry level were filled internally in FY2023. Such \\ninvestments help us to attract, develop, and retain the \\ntop talent needed to continue bringing our purpose \\nto life.  Rewiring our business for a low-carbon future: \\nWe are committed to achieving our science-based \\ntargets; last year we achieved a cumulative 23% \\nreduction in GHG emissions from our own operations \\nrelative to our 2015 baseline year and have progressed \\ntoward our goal of being powered by 100% renewable \\nenergy. We continue to take meaningful action to \\ndecarbonize product value chains; through Project \\nGigaton, Walmart suppliers report having reduced \\nor avoided over 750 million metric tons of emissions \\nsince 2017. As electric vehicle (EV) ownership grows, \\nwe are building our own EV fast-charging network \\nat thousands of Walmart and Sam’s Club locations \\ncoast to coast to create a convenient, reliable, \\nand affordable charging option for customers. We \\nbelieve our leadership on energy and emissions in the \\ncoming decade can create value for our business and \\nstakeholders. \\nWe invite you to read our FY2023 ESG Highlights and \\nthe accompanying ESG Issue Briefs  to learn more \\nabout how we continue to strengthen our business by \\ncreating value for our stakeholders. \\nKathleen McLaughlin \\nEVP and Chief Sustainability Officer \\nWalmart Inc.\\n LEADERSHIP LETTERSFY2023  \\nESG Highlights 5 Opportunity Sustainability Community Ethics & Integrity\\n Introduction',\n",

The aim is to divert 100 percent of waste from  \\nlandfills. We provide tools and guidance, including the services of experts in sustainable  \\nwaste management.\\nInitially we prioritized suppliers with the most significant waste impact: final assembly facilities \\nwhere components from all over the world come together to be assembled into Apple \\nproducts. Our goal was to help these facilities drastically reduce the waste they send to landfill. \\nAnd in 2018, we achieved UL ’s Zero Waste to Landfill certification for all final assembly facilities \\nacross iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, AirPods, and HomePod.25 This includes the Apple-\\noperated final assembly site in Cork, Ireland, which was the first Apple facility to receive the \\ndesignation from UL. \\nWe’ve since expanded our efforts further upstream in our supply chain to include sub-assembly \\nsuppliers. However, the deeper we go, the more complex the waste streams become. So we are \\nlooking for new technological innovations, exploring up-cycling techniques to reuse by-products, \\nand even reassessing manufacturing processes.\\nIn 2018, we diverted 375,000 metric tons of waste from landfills. And to date, we’ve engaged \\n90 suppliers and diverted more than 1 million metric tons of waste—enough to cover more than \\n4,000 soccer fields a meter deep.\\nWater Stewardship\\nProtecting Earth’s most  \\nprecious resource.\\nWater supports all life on Earth.

So we hold ourselves accountable for the water we use, \\nwhether at our corporate offices, data centers, distribution centers, and retail stores, or at our \\nsuppliers’ facilities around the globe.\\nHow we’re tackling our water footprint.\\nWater is necessary to operate our corporate facilities, including for cooling at our data centers. \\nAt our manufacturing facilities, suppliers use water for processes like etching, cutting, cleaning, \\nand cooling. So we work to conserve it and be smarter about the water we do use. We focus \\nboth on improving water use in our facilities and—through our Clean Water Program—helping \\nour suppliers conserve water and prevent water pollution.
